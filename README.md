# integrated-chinese-level-1-part-1-anki-guide

Since I already put in the effort to modify an existing Anki deck extensively to work nicely with the Integrated Chinese Textbook Vocabulary, I decided that I may as well also be a nice person and write a guide for yall as well. 

ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

This guide will provide useful links and instructions for setting up Anki and some useful flash card decks for learning Integrated Chinese 1 Part 1.
# What is Anki
Anki is a nifty flash card application which is great for learning vocabulary. Check out more details about how it works [here](https://docs.ankiweb.net/background.html). It makes it easy for us to consistently study **every day** and memorise things better.

When set up, using it might look something like this:

# Instructions
1. Install Anki on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387)
   - For some reason, it costs **$40 AUD!!** on iOS (free on android ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š) but [ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/decks) still works on a mobile browser and is optimised for it - see more deets in FAQ below
   - Desktop version is also available for [free](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
2. Download and Import Anki Decks
   - We can look for decks other people have made [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks)
   - Unfortunately, the pre-existing decks have had some issues so I modified them to make them better
   - Download [Traditional-TODO: insert link] or [Simplified-TODO: insert link] Integrated Chinese Level 1 Part 1 decks
     - if the link isn't working, download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FtPJJ5nphCynnejm6BamGeVRyMt8pBBJ/view?usp=sharing)
   - I also recommend downloading a [Chinese Radical Anki Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/842457706) especially if you plan on continuing your chinese studies
   - Import these decks into your anki application
3. Set up your settings and start studying!
   - Start by Making a general Options Group with a very large new card limit (100) and review limit (1000) and set the main "Integrated Chinese ..." Deck to use these options
   - Make a general Subdeck Options Group with a smaller card limit (e.g 5) and review limit (e.g 60) and set each of the subdecks to use these options
      - if you want, you can make separate option groups for every single deck/subdeck if you want to modify your pace of learning for different decks/components

# General Use Terminology and Tips

**New Cards**: the max number of new cards you learn each day for a specific deck

**Reviews**: the max number of old cards which you can review each day for a specific deck

**Note**: A collection of related information which relates to something we are learning. In our case, this would be a bunch of info relating to a specific chinese vocab.

**Card**: A single flashcard which uses some information from a note. Often a single note has multiple cards, e.g in my deck, we have separate cards for testing reading, writing and definition recall. If you decide to edit/suspend/delete a card, make sure that you don't get note and card mixed up and end up deleting more than you intended to.

**Custom Study**: Lets you modify the number of new cards and reviews you have to do for just today

**Suspending**: Effectively hiding a card or note

I strongly recommend playing around with a bunch of settings and options to get a better understanding of what things do. It will be greatly beneficial for you as you can make small adjustments based on your preferences so that you can learn better.

If any other terms come up, you can find more details about what everything does in the [Anki Manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/studying.html) or alternatively just googling (which is how I made everything here).

# How I use these decks / General Suggestions

My deck has tags marked with Z mean that they are words introduced in that chapter but not words part of the main vocabulary list. It would be a good idea to skip/suspend/bury some of these cards if you don't think they are useful. You can see all of these cards using the Card Browser (and filter for specific tags if necessary)

Subdecks are rearranged into 3 subdecks:
    - audio -> word (Character): 
    - definition -> word (Pinyin):  
    - reading -> definition: 

When learning new words, I personally like to study 
1. reading -> definition first focusing on getting correct definition
2. definition -> word(pinyin) next focusing on getting correct pinyin
3. audio -> word (character) last focusing on writing characters 

Note that all notes have a card for each of the subdecks, some of these cards may not make sense so feel free to delete the card when this occurs. If you do this, make sure to delete/suspend the card and not the note by accident. I like to use custom study to make sure that i'm up to the same word for all 3 subdecks. 

At the start, it would be a good idea to custom study a high number of words so that you can quickly go through all the vocabulary which you have already learnt.

# FAQ

### Syncing
- Syncing between different platforms requires making an account so do that.

### IOS??
- AnkiWeb is a suitable free alternative to the iOS app so give that a try
   - importing decks may require you to import using the Desktop App then Sync to AnkiWeb
- (According to Reddit) Disadvantages of ankiweb seems to be
  - cannot edit cards in browser
  - have to download images/audio each time (so sad for mobile data / is more laggy)
- It is a good idea to try ankiweb to see if you like it before committing to purchasing the app
  - There are other flash card options on iOS which are free but you are going to have to do your own research and make/find decks for those yourself ðŸ˜Š

### Help Why Are Things Wrong/Broken!?!?!?!

- I've tried my best to make the cards in the deck correct with ordering matching the lessons but there might still be mistakes
 - let me know what's wrong but it is probably easiest if you manually modify the cards/notes yourself for small mistakes
 - for big mistakes, I might update the deck properly / provide instructions on how to fix

# Useful Links??

If my deck ends up being horrendously broken and I make a big fix then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTHpODHBk3U) might help?? 

# How did I get here

I had to make lots of changes to existing decks to make something nice and useful - sadly the nicest deck I could find had traditional characters not simplified so like any good programmer I decided to avoid 1 hour of boring manually searching up (520!) cards! and replacing each traditional character to a simplified character by doing it 

âœ¨âœ¨ programatically âœ¨âœ¨ 

making it take 5 hours instead ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š (or however long it took idk but it took longer than it should have).
