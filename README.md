# integrated-chinese-level-1-part-1-anki-guide

Since I already put in the effort to modify an existing Anki deck extensively to work nicely with the Integrated Chinese Textbook Vocabulary, I decided that I may as well also be a nice person and write a guide for yall as well.

# What is Anki
Anki is a nifty flash card application which is great for learning vocabulary. Check out more details about how it works [here](https://docs.ankiweb.net/background.html).

When set up, using it might look something like this:

# Instructions
1. Install Anki on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387)
   - For some reason, it costs **$40 AUD!!** on iOS (free on android ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š) but [ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/decks) still works on a mobile browser and is optimised for it - see more deets in FAQ below
   - Desktop version is also available for [free](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
2. Download and Import Anki Decks
   - We can look for decks other people have made [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks)
   - Unfortunately, the pre-existing decks have had some issues so I modified them to make them better
   - Download [Traditional-TODO: insert link] or [Simplified-TODO: insert link] Integrated Chinese Level 1 Part 1 decks
     - while the link isn't active yet, download the apkg file accompanied with this README
   - I also recommend downloading a [Chinese Radical Anki Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/842457706) especially if you plan on continuing your chinese studies
   - Import these decks into your anki application
  3. Set up your settings and start studying!

# General Use Tips


You can find more details about what everything does in the [Anki Manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/studying.html) or alternatively just googling (which is how I made everything here).

# FAQ

IOS??
- 

Costs $40 AUD on ios lmaao
- ankiweb is still free and mobile optimised so you can just use that on ios devices
- Disadvantages of ankiweb seems to be
  - cannot edit cards in browser
  - have to download images/audio each time (so sad for mobile data / is more laggy)
  - probably a good idea to try using on browser to see if you like it before committing to purchasing the app
  - There are other flash card options on ios which are free but you are going to have to do your own research and make/find decks for those yourself ðŸ˜Š
  - Free! on Android

# How did I get here

I had to make lots of changes to existing decks to make something nice and useful - sadly the nicest deck I could find had traditional characters not simplified so like any good programmer I decided to avoid 1 hour of boring manually searching up (520!) cards! and replacing each traditional character to a simplified character by doing it 

âœ¨âœ¨ programatically âœ¨âœ¨ 

making it take 5 hours instead ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š (or however long it took idk but it took longer than it should have).
